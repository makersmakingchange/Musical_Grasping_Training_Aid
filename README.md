## Overview

The Musical Grasping Training Aid is an assistive technology device that plays music when the device is grasped and pauses when it is let go. The user may upload their selection of songs onto the microSD card inside the device.

The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts.

The Musical Grasping Training Aid is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

The overall cost of materials is about $90 (plus $5 for component shipping).
